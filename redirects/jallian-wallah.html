        1. Background & Build-Up
After World War I, India was facing political unrest. The British had promised political reforms in return for Indian support in the war, but instead passed the Rowlatt Act (1919), which allowed:
• Arrest without warrant
• Imprisonment without trial
• Trials without jury
This was seen as a betrayal, and protests erupted all over the country.
In Punjab, the protests were especially strong. Two popular leaders, Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal, were arrested on 10 April 1919 in Amritsar for opposing the Rowlatt Act. This sparked anger among the people.

• Why People Came:
1.Many villagers came to Amritsar for the Baisakhi fair.
2.Others came to attend a peaceful meeting to protest against the Rowlatt Act and demand the release of Kitchlew and Satyapal.
Important: The meeting was peaceful and unarmed.

3. The Massacre
• The British military officer General Reginald Dyer heard about the gathering and considered it a violation of his ban on public meetings.
• Without any warning to disperse, Dyer:

2.Blocked the main exit.
3.Ordered firing directly into the crowd.
• Duration of firing: Around 10 minutes.
• Bullets fired: Approximately 1,650 rounds.
• Casualties (official British figures): 379 killed, over 1,200 injured.
Indian sources claimed the numbers were much higher.
